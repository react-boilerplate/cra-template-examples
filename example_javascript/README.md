# React Boilerplate CRA Template Examples & Tutorials

## Javascript Example

### ⚠️This is NOT THE `Javascript` version. The boilerplate works both in `JS` and `TS` even though its completely built with `TS`

Here this example is meant to show `JS` lovers that you can mix `Javascript` and `Typescript` in your code as you wish. You are not forced to code your application with `TS`.

All the example application code in here is replaced with the `js` files removing all the `ts` features. So everything works like just it does in `TS` version. You can take a look at the `src/app` folder and compare the pros&cons of both languages.
